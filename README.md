# remote-connection-tool

This is a personal project that will be used to connect single-board computers such as Raspberry PI from another computer. 



## To-do

I will add screenshot feature. 
I will try to move the mouse remotely in case I need to open a GUI from the single-board computer. This may be useful while creating bots.
Add authentication.
